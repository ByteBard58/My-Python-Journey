# ðŸ‘€ Begining with Youtube

At the very beigining of my python journey, I watched a playlist of a youtube channel. 

In this folder, I have included the files which I worked with during learning from that playlist.

This playlist helped me a lot to understand the very basics of python and to set the start of the journey.
