# Learning flask 

Well I didn't want to want to watch a particular flask tutorial, but I think it's something which I really need to watch other REST API tutorials. 

The tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA)

## Review
Just finished watching the video, and it was TRASH (to me). The instructor didn't clearly explained what the code does and how it works. It just felt to me that I am just "memorizing" code and pasting them in the script. Absolutely not recommended.
