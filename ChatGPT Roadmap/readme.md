# üõ† Python Automation+AI & ML Learning Roadmap 

This folder contains all the `.py` files, scripts, notes, and practice tasks I'm doing based on a **custom roadmap** I‚Äôm following ‚Äî specifically designed to help me **learn automation with Python** 

When I finished watching that playlist (mentioned in Sherys folder), I asked ChatGPT about my next works and a future path. And it gave me this BIG roadmap which I am currently following. In this folder, I have included (and will include) all of the files which I created during learning by following that roadmap. Please let me know your thoughts about my decision to rely on an AI-created roadmap and anyhting else. 

## üìÅ Folder Naming Convention

Each subfolder = one topic or milestone from the roadmap.

I have included that roadmap in a pdf file named "ChatGPT Roadmap.pdf", give it a look if you want to. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTICE

I decided to transition into full-fledged data science and AI/ML stack during the third phase of this roadmap. It‚Äôs been an absolute delight to learn Python basics and beyond. For more information on this, please visit my new repository. You can find it [here](https://github.com/ByteBard58/Data-Science-Roadmap).
