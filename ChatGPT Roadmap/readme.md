# 🛠 Python Automation+AI & ML Learning Roadmap 

This folder contains all the `.py` files, scripts, notes, and practice tasks I'm doing based on a **custom roadmap** I’m following — specifically designed to help me **learn automation with Python** 

When I finished watching that playlist (mentioned in Sherys folder), I asked ChatGPT about my next works and a future path. And it gave me this BIG roadmap which I am currently following. In this folder, I have included (and will include) all of the files which I created during learning by following that roadmap. Please let me know your thoughts about my decision to rely on an AI-created roadmap and anyhting else. 

## 📁 Folder Naming Convention

Each subfolder = one topic or milestone from the roadmap.

I have included that roadmap in a pdf file named "ChatGPT Roadmap.pdf", give it a look if you want to.
