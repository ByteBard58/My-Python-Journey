# The Projects üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to my project collection!

In this folder, you'll find all the projects I‚Äôve built (and will continue to build) as part of my learning journey. I focus on creating practical, lesson-aligned projects that actually **work** ‚Äî not just theory, but real, functioning stuff.

Feel free to explore the projects. If you have any feedback or suggestions, I‚Äôd love to hear from you!

## Under Construction ‚ò¢

Each subfolder represents a single project. You can find information about a project in it's readme.md section.
