# 🧠 Python Learning Log by Sakib

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey** — this is a structured, topic-wise collection of everything I've been learning in Python, organized by folder.

Each folder contains `.py` files with both code and detailed notes written using `#` comments. I'm using this repo as my personal notebook, codebase, and revision kit — all in one.

# 🔍 Why I’m Doing This

I'm a student from Bangladesh and I am 16 years old, working towards a future in **Computer Science**, **AI**, and **Automation**.

Since I don't come from a privileged background, I’m building my way up by:
- Learning practical skills on my own
- Creating small, real-world focused projects
- Keeping everything transparent on GitHub to document my journey

## 🌟 Final Note

1. This isn't a fancy portfolio or a polished set of apps.  
2. This is **raw, honest learning in progress** — shared publicly to show consistency, growth, and curiosity.
3. I am one of the noobest coder on earth right now, and I am on my begining phase. You may find things  which will make you laugh like hell. So please, bear with those.
4. If you want to use any part of my code, go ahead and do it ! 
5. Please let me know if you have any suggestions, reccomandation or anything else.
